interact with different datastore connectors on Google Cloud.

**Tags:** `tool`, `API`

### MCP BMI SSE

[MCP BMI SSE](./examples/mcp_bmi_sse.md) is an agent that calls a tool in MCP server via server-sent events (sse) to
calculate BMI. It serves as an example of how to connect to MCP servers in coded tools.

**Tags:** `tool`, `MCP`

### A2A RESEARCH REPORT

[A2A RESEARCH REPORT](./examples/a2a_research_report.md) is an agent that uses a coded tool as an A2A client to connect
to crewAI agents in an A2A server to write a report on a provided topic. This is an example of how to link
neuro-san with other agentic frameworks.

**Tags:** `tool`, `A2A`, `CrewAI`

### PDF RAG Assistant

[PDF RAG Assistant](./examples/pdf_rag.md) is an agent-based system that answers user queries by retrieving information
from specified PDF files using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It processes input through a frontman agent and a
PDF retrieval tool, enabling accurate responses from static documents.

**Tags:** `tool`, `RAG`

### Agentic RAG Assistant

[Agentic RAG Assistant](./examples/agentic_rag.md) is a modular multi-agent system that answers user queries by
retrieving information from the web, PDF documents, and Slack channels. It mimics a smart assistant that delegates tasks
to specialized tools and compiles responses into clear, helpful answers.
